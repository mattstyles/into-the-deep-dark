# [into-the-deep-dark](https://mattstyles.github.io/into-the-deep-dark)

It’s getting darker out there...

## Getting Started

The project uses yarn to manage the workspaces.

```sh
yarn
yarn run setup
yarn run dev
```

The `dev` command starts watching all packages and launches the dev build of the application. This provides incremental rebuilds on changes, and will only rebuild those packages that have changed.

## Contributing
